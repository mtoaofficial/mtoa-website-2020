                            Late Shri Kantibhai Patani, a visionary was a leading tour organizer amongst the Jain
                            community established Kantibhai Patani Tours (Pride of Gujarati Tourists) on 15.08.1967. He
                            was a renowned social worker in South Mumbai and provided honorary services in different
                            capacities to social organizations. <br>When organizing special trains was a dream for any
                            other tour operator in 1968, in the very second year of his association with the business,
                            Shri Kantibhai organized a special train for his NRI clientele. The special train had all
                            first class coaches which moved around the whole of India for an All India Tour. After that,
                            there was no turning back. <br>Shri Kantibhai was associated with the organization (MTOA)
                            since its inception in 1969. His valuable suggestions, cooperative nature and ambitious
                            attitude to deal with Indian Railway Authorities have been a very valuable contribution for
                            the functioning of our organization.<br> Adding a feather to his cap of success, in 1972,
                            when other tour operators had not even thought of foreign tours, Kantibhai Patani Tours
                            successfully organized a 35 days Europe Tour for the Kolhapur Shroff Merchant’s Association.
                            He laid down the valuable principles of organizing tours with honesty and loyalty. In his
                            view, one must avoid internal competition of rates and provide competitive services to the
                            tourists which would pay all of us in the long run. <br>At a relatively young age of 59
                            years, he unexpectedly passed away at 4.00 am on 19.10.1979. Nevertheless, his son conducted
                            the Special Train scheduled for departure at 12.39 pm, just 9 hours after his sad demise. It
                            was a tribute to his lifelong motto - "The Show Must Go On..."</p>

                            Mr. Guruji had tried his very best to explain and convince all Tour operators to form an
                            association of all tour operators in Maharashtra to bring Harmony among themselves.

                            After many difficulties all tour operators have finally agreed to form Maharashtra Tour
