                                    In Maharashtra
                                </strong></h4>
                            <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Tourism development in India has passed
                                through many phases. But it was only after the 80's that tourism activity gained
                                momentum. Prior to that it was being conducted on a very small scale in various parts of
                                the country for pilgrimage.
                                <br>
                                <br>The name Maharashtra is believed to be originated from Rathi, which means chariot
                                driver. Maharashtra entered the recorded history in the 2nd century BC, with the
                                construction of its first Buddhist caves. The name, Maharashtra first appeared in 7th
                                century in the account of a contemporary Chinese traveler, Huan Tsang. According to the
                                recorded history, the first Hindu King ruled the state during 6th century, based in
                                Badami.
                                <br>
                                <br>Initially, tourism in India meant going on pilgrimage tours. The practice of
                                pilgrimage in India is so deeply embedded in the cultural psyche and the number of
                                pilgrimage sites is so large that the entire subcontinent may actually be regarded as
                                one grand and continuous sacred space.
                                <br>
                                <br>In Maharashtra, taking pilgrimage tours was started by Mr. Dahyabhai, Ambika Yatra
                                in 1950. Mr Pratapbhai Bhatia and Mr Dahyabhai Singhadia were the owners of this
                                venture. Though they expected the Gujarati Community to go with them in large numbers,
                                the fact was that their Pilgrimage tours comprised of 80% Maharashtrian’s and 20%
                                Gujrathi’s.
                                <br>
                                <br>Later Tours to Char Dham were started in 1957 by Datta Digambar Yatra Company, a
                                Travel venture by Mr Dattaray Digambar Kulkarni. At that point in time, the only mode of
                                transport available was rail. Railways used to assign specially designed coaches for
                                these tours. Capacity of the coach used to be 38 to 42 passengers and included a
                                kitchen, toilet and bathroom. These coaches were called as CTT - CLASS TOURIST THIRD and
                                later upgraded as CTS - CLASS TOURIST SECOND. The backbone of this industry was our
                                Indian Railways who took initiative to promote tourism and offered railway coaches for
                                maximum 30 days. They were flexible and supportive and did extend the duration if
                                required in few cases.<br><br>This was followed by a series of similar ventures. One of
                                them was Kishore Travel Services in Pune started by Mr P W Alias Dada Pakhode in 1958.
                                In the year 1960, focus shifted from pilgrimage tours a bit. H K Lala Company ventured
                                into school groups and became the main player to initiate tours to various destinations.
                                <br>
                                <br>Another area that opened up was Leisure tours. Mr Raja Patil started Raja Travels in
                                1959 and started family tours to Kashmir &amp; various other parts of India. Around the
                                same time, Mr D M Kirane started Jai Lakshmi Yatra Company and Mr. Joshi started
                                Maharashtra Travel services in Pune with the same objective. In 1964, Royal Tours,
                                Bharat Darshan, Santosh Tours and Aradhana Travels started conducting tours to various
                                destinations.
                                <br>
                                <br>One of the first tours to Amarnath was conducted by Mr Pakhode , Kishore Travel.
                                Since the destination was accessible only during a particular period and the facilities
                                were limited, it was not an easy task. All tours had the concept of a mobile kitchen
                                that is they moved around with cooks and a full stock of groceries to ensure hygienic
                                and quality food that suited the palates of its travelers.
                                <br>
                                <br>The year mid 60’s saw a boom of tour operators in the market. All of them used the
                                medium of advertisement in local newspapers to attract tourists. These advertisement
                                campaigns were very interesting and quite competitive. As the market grew and tourism
                                expanded, the demand for railway coaches started increasing. It became very difficult to
                                get rail coach booking. Due to this situation, all agents approached Hon. Balasaheb
                                Thakre to ease out the booking process. This was the first agitation against the
                                railways and took place under the leadership of Hon Balasaheb Thakre, Mr. Raja Patil
                                &amp; Mr. Lala. The agitation was successful and the railway authorities confirmed
                                coaches for all Tour operators within 2 days. This success united the agents on a common
                                platform.
                                <br>
                                <br>Since all tour operators realized the advantage of being united, all Maharashtra
                                tour operators came together to form the "Maharashtra Tour Organisers' Association"
                                (MTOA) in the year 1969. Shri. Bhagubhai Shah was appointed the first President of this
                                Association. In the subsequent years, this post was handled by Shri. H K Lala, Shri.
                                Balubhai Shah, Shri. P W Pakhode, Shri. Raja Patil, Shri. Kishore Guruji, Shri. Atul
                                Mohile, Shri. Sudhir Patil &amp; now Shri. Prabhulal Joshi.
                                <br>
                                <br>The objective of the MTOA was to take up issues related to tourism in the various
                                parts of India and provide improved facilities and amenities to the tourists. The
                                Association also took up the railway issue whenever it cropped up. The person who
                                contributed the most in this effort was Shri Bal Saheb Mane - Member of Parliament at
                                that point in time.
                                <br>
                                <br>In 1994, the Maharashtra Tour Organisers Association was registered as a "Trust" and
                                obtained Registration no. - F16477(Mumbai). The founder members were Shri. Raja Patil,
                                Shri. Kishore Guruji, Shri. Atul Mohile, Shri. Arvind Jog and Shri. Sudhakar Mahajan.
                                <br>
                                <br>During same time Mr. Kantibhai Patani from Patani Travels conducted inbound Jain
                                Pilgrimage group tours to India from Kenya and South Africa.
                                <br>
                                <br>During the past years the MTOA handled different issues with various State Tourism
                                Boards such as Jammu &amp; Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, West Bengal, Kerala and
                                various other state and central authorities from time to time.
